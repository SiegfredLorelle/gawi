# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working in this repository.

This is the **single source of truth** for agent guidance. `CLAUDE.md` imports
this file rather than duplicating it, and any other tool's config file
(`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `GEMINI.md`,
`.windsurfrules`) should be a one-line pointer here. Do not copy content out
of this file — it will drift.

<!-- TODO: replace this line with what the project actually is. -->

## Commands

Always use these. Never guess at the underlying tool — the Makefile is the
contract, and it is the same in every repo regardless of language.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | Install dependencies and git hooks |
| `make fmt` | Format the codebase |
| `make lint` | Lint and type-check |
| `make test` | Run the test suite |

Run `make lint` and `make test` before considering any change complete.

## Commit messages

Enforced by a `commit-msg` hook and by CI. Commits that break these rules are
rejected, so get them right the first time:

- Format `type(scope): subject`, header **50 characters maximum**
- Scope is **required**, kebab-case, **12 characters maximum** — prefer one
  short word (`auth`, `api`, `db`, `ui`, `ci`, `deps`)
- Types: `feat` `fix` `docs` `style` `refactor` `perf` `test` `build` `ci`
  `chore` `revert`
- Subject: lowercase first word, imperative mood, no trailing period
- **Blank line between header and body** — required
- Body wrapped at **72 characters**
- Long URLs and `Co-Authored-By:` trailers go in the footer, which has no
  length limit. Never put a long URL in the body; it cannot be wrapped and
  will fail the check.

## Conventions

<!-- TODO: fill in per project. Suggestions:
     - Directory layout and where new code belongs
     - Naming patterns to follow
     - Error handling and logging approach
     - What must never be edited by hand (generated files, lockfiles)
     - Testing expectations for new code
-->

## Secrets

Never commit real credentials. `gitleaks` runs as a pre-commit hook and again
in CI. Add every new configuration variable to `.env.example` with a
placeholder value.
